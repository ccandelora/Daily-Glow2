# Daily Glow Onboarding Flow Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for updating the onboarding flow in the Daily Glow application to be more streamlined and maintainable.

## Current Issues
- Complex onboarding flow logic with redundant checks
- Potential for navigation bugs due to delayed routing
- Lack of clear organization for onboarding screens

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Simplified Routing Structure
- Update `app/(onboarding)/index.tsx` to directly redirect to welcome screen
- Ensure all onboarding screens exist in the correct directory structure
- Implement a clear navigation flow between screens

### 2. Onboarding Context Improvements
- Refactor OnboardingContext to handle onboarding completion status efficiently
- Simplify the API for checking and updating onboarding status
- Add proper persistence using AsyncStorage

### 3. Screen Implementation
- Implement the following screens:
  - Welcome screen
  - Preferences/personalization screen
  - Final onboarding completion screen
- Each screen will have a clear call-to-action to proceed to the next step

### 4. Completion Logic
- Add finalization logic in the last onboarding screen
- Mark onboarding as complete in AsyncStorage and context
- Redirect to main app screens after completion

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Test navigation flow through all onboarding screens
- Test persistence of onboarding status
- Test proper redirection to main app after completed onboarding
- Test reinstallation scenario (fresh install after previous usage)
