UPGRADE STRATEGY:
1. Dependency Audit
   - PROBLEM: Outdated dependencies cause compatibility issues
   - ACTION: Create inventory of all packages with needed updates
   - REASONING: Establishes baseline without breaking functionality

2. SDK Migration
   - PROBLEM: Older SDK versions lack performance improvements
   - ACTION: Follow incremental upgrade path (never skip major versions)
   - REASONING: Breaking changes between major releases require step-by-step migration

3. Navigation Refactoring
   - PROBLEM: Legacy navigation patterns don't benefit from file-based routing
   - ACTION: Migrate to Expo Router with proper nesting and linking
   - REASONING: Improves developer experience and enables better deep linking

4. Build System Modernization
   - PROBLEM: Classic build workflow lacks OTA capabilities
   - ACTION: Migrate to EAS Build and Update
   - REASONING: Enables continuous delivery model
