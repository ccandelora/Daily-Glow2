# Achievement, Badge, and Streak System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to fix the achievement, badge, and streak systems in the Daily Glow app. The issues primarily stem from the app using mock data instead of properly integrating with the database tables.

## Current Issues

1. **Achievement System Issues**:
   - Using hardcoded mock achievements instead of database data
   - Achievement detection and awarding logic is incomplete
   - UI doesn't update properly when achievements are earned

2. **Badge System Issues**:
   - Badge initialization has inconsistent error handling
   - Badge award criteria are not clearly defined
   - Integration with achievements and streaks is missing
   - UI doesn't refresh properly when new badges are earned

3. **Streak System Issues**:
   - Streak calculation logic doesn't accurately reflect consecutive day streaks
   - The `profiles` table and `user_streaks` table aren't properly synchronized
   - Streak reset logic when a day is missed is incorrect
   - No clear definition of what constitutes "maintaining a streak"

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a modular approach to address each system while ensuring they work together seamlessly:

1. **Phase 1: Streak System Improvements** (4 days)
   - Implement proper streak calculation
   - Fix streak synchronization between tables
   - Implement proper streak reset logic

2. **Phase 2: Achievement System Implementation** (7 days)
   - Ensure database tables exist
   - Implement real achievement service
   - Fix achievement detection and awarding
   - Update UI components

3. **Phase 3: Badge System Improvements** (5 days)
   - Create comprehensive badge service
   - Improve badge context
   - Integrate with achievements and streaks
   - Update UI components

4. **Phase 4: Integration and Testing** (5 days)
   - Integrate all systems
   - Implement comprehensive testing
   - Fix any issues that arise
   - Final UI polish

- Add loading states and animations

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing

#### Day 1-2: System Integration
- Connect all systems (streaks, achievements, badges)
- Implement unified state management
- Ensure events in one system trigger appropriate actions in others

#### Day 3-4: Comprehensive Testing
- Test all user flows and edge cases
- Verify database consistency
- Test UI updates and animations
- Perform regression testing on related features

#### Day 5: Final Refinements
- Address any remaining issues
- Add final UI polish
- Update documentation
- Prepare for release
